## 0.4.0.skroutz.0 (2019-02-26)

 * Enable non forking resque workers when `fork_per_job: false` is present for a queue's workers
 * YAML config file to support `workers` and `fork_per_job` keys
 * Depend on a resque version >= 1.23.1

## 0.3.0 (2012-05-22)

This is mostly just a long overdue maintenance release.  Many pull requests were
merged.  A few non-pull-request branches were merged too.  This version supports
ruby 1.9.3, 1.8.7, and even ancient 1.8.6, and all are checked by
[travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org/nevans/resque-pool).  It also explicitly
supports resque ~> 1.20.  And (if you have `gem-man` installed), it now has man
pages for bin and yml config.

Many thanks to the contributers!

## 0.2.0 (2011-03-15)

  gracefully restart all workers.
* enhancement: logging now includes timestamp, process "name" (worker or
  manager), and PID.
* enhancement: can be used with no config file or empty config file (not all
  *that* useful, but it's better than unceromoniously dieing!)

  kill-9'd (Jason Haruska)
* bugfix: TERM/INT are no longer ignored when HUP is waiting on children
